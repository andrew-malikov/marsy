# MARS-~~X~~Y

# Run

```sh
cat research-mission-0.txt | dotnet run --project MarsY.Mission.Cli
```

or without piping:

```sh
dotnet run --project MarsY.Mission.Cli
```

then paste this thing:

```
5 3
1 1 E
RFRFRFRF
3 2 N
FRRFLLFFRRFLL
0 3 W
LLFFFLFLFL
```

and send EOF via CTRL-D or CMD-D (don't rememeber), there's smth similar for windows CTRL-Z and press enter (I've never tried, may not work).

## License

I don't know what **License** means, however if you decide to use it on Mars I may get a lawsuit on your head.
